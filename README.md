In this repository you can find all extension, the extension .json file and version.json.

If you are looking for the source code, go to  [source/imporvedFactions](https://github.com/ToberoCat/ImprovedFaction/tree/master/Source/ImprovedFactions). In there you will find diffrent projects. The ImprovedFactions old plugin will be without anything.

If you want to see the current new plugin, go to ImprovedFactions_new. Lite is currently empty.

If you want to write your own extensions take a look at the existing ones. They are in [source/extensions](https://github.com/ToberoCat/ImprovedFaction/tree/master/Source/Extensions). If you need help, join my [discord](https://discord.gg/VmSbFNZejz)
